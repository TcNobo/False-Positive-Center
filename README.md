# False-Positive-Center
Repository to help security vendors deal with false positives, improving their detection engine, and centralize information for software developers making it easier to submit false positives to AV companies.

The repository lists the emails, and websites security vendors (antivirus companies) used to receive false positive reports it's an effort to facilitate communication between software developers and security vendors.

[AV companies are not responsive? Look at the bottom for additional details.](#av-companies-are-not-responsive)

### AV companies are not responsive?
There could be a scenario where an antivirus/security company is not responsive, but to be sure that the issue is not on your end (especially if you're sending emails from your own domain). Check that your DNS records are set up correctly for good deliverability. Add an SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to your DNS records. Some AV companies may ignore emails that are not set up correctly, and some will send a response email with an error, depending on how the individual company is setup.

To check if your DNS is configured correctly, as well as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, use the Google [Check MX](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/checkmx/) tool.

To do a final verification if the email was verified correctly in SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, send an email to a secondary email account and take a look at the full record to see if it passed. You're looking for this:

![EmailPass](https://github.com/yaronelh/False-Positive-Center/blob/main/EmailPass.png?raw=true)

If you did find an error in your configuration, consider resending the emails you already sent before the fix.

**TIP:** while SPF, and DKIM are relatively simple to setup, you can speed up the DMARC setup by searching for DMARC generator with your favorite search engine, to use a wizard to generate it instead of doing it manually.
